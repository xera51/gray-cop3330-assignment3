## A Couple of Notes
<ul>
    <li>I have activity diagrams instead of pseudocode. 
        All UML documents can be found in /docs/</li>
    <li>Runner (In /src/main/exercises/main/) can be 
        used to run exercises, either one at a time or
        all one after the other (Pausing when user input is needed)</li>
    <li>All output files are created in the working directory</li>
</ul>
